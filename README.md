# SLO Weather Index

This was a project I started back when I was new to R and Python and was looking for a project to hone my skills.   
  
Before moving to houston I spent 6 years in San Luis Obispo, CA while attending Cal Poly for a BS/MS degree, which was recently dubbed the ["happiest city in America"](http://www.oprah.com/oprahshow/happiest-city-in-america-san-luis-obispo-video) by none other than Oprah (so it must be true). Since the weather was essentially "perfect" all year long, I wanted to dive into the data to see what this could be attributed to, and also see if an "index" could be created in which to compare the annual weather traits of other locations in the world to that of SLO. In the simplest form, I envisioned this to be something like "Number of SLO days per year": nearby cities like Santa Barbara or locations along the same latitude would likely have a majority of "SLO days" (~ 300/year), but more seasonal locations along the east coast or midwest would likely only have a handful each year (< 100).   
  
While this project stalled out before I came up with the index algorithm, I did write some reusable code for scrapping [Weather Underground](www.wunderground.com) for annual weather stats and processing/visualizing this data in R.
